# IT Security

### My current major focus of IT work is IT Security. In these times, and increasingly so, regardless of global pandemics and having the inmates in charge of the asylum, where most of the future focus should be found.

### I recently (April, 2020) obtained my Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH, v10) certification. I intend to delve as deeply as I can into related skills and do my part to combat the Black Hats as a White Hat.
