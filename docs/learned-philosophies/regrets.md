Live long enough and there are two things you will certainly acquire; enemies and regrets.  Perhaps add also debt.

I&#8217;m not talking about small regrets, things like, &#8220;Maybe I should have had the salad&#8221; as the soup congeals around the rim of the bowl, I&#8217;m talking about regrets we remember for the rest of our lives. I think we have regrets like we have earthquakes; some are major events, while some are aftershocks, because they are in some way connected to the major events.  We see them as things we should have done differently, having had the opportunity to learn that particular lesson already.

I think this is because the common thread running through each major and minor regret really boils down to disappointment.&nbsp; That is, things we did/did not do that we should have done, when given the opportunity, when we should have known better.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; If we capitalized on the opportunity that we had an ability to recognize given our experience, it wouldn&#8217;t be a regret.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

When we have a major event, it shakes us (so to speak) to the core.&nbsp; It illustrates any significant disappointment we have in ourselves.&nbsp; It can also define our relationship with someone else involved in the event.&nbsp; Bearing this in mind, the aftershocks seem to trace back to the time when the major event occurred and that lesson was (or at least should have been) learned.

By way of illustration, a personal example:

One of the things I most regret in my life was not going to college.  When I say this to someone, I usually get the question &#8220;Why?&#8221;  Or, rather, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go to college?&#8221;.  The short version is that it was simply not at the forefront of my thinking at such a young age and that there was no one who made an effort to place it there. Why not? Was I completely unaware of a higher education and potential benefits therein?  Probably not.  Did the people in a place of influence in my life at that time consider college to be of little value or too far out of reach for me?  Again, probably not.  The truth is, I don&#8217;t really know at this point.  Nonetheless, it remains a significant regret

But was that the question I was being asked?  Maybe I simply heard the question I was most comfortable in answering. Maybe the question really was, &#8220;What do you think you would have received from college that you haven&#8217;t received from life?&#8221;  A better question. For me, from my perspective many years hence, I think that the opportunity could have, even would have contributed many positive things to my life.  Right away, I think there was a potential to have had a &#8220;jump start&#8221; on the world in general.  I think that would have come about with an introduction to many different thoughts, ideas and perspectives that an 18-year-old just doesn&#8217;t yet have.  Add to that the potential social experience, the potential career path resulting, and so on.  Potential.  

Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I have done well (if I do say so myself) with my career and life despite not having gone to college. In my work in corporate IT, I went from field technician to three different levels of Director and a position as Chief Architect. And this (through acquisitions and the like) for a company manufactured super computers. I knew simply that I had to work for what I wanted, that no one was going to give me anything and that I had to prove myself every time, over and over again. As I also say, you may not be the smartest or the strongest, but if you can out work everyone else, you will succeed. My work ethic I got from my father.

In the end, without having gone to college, I will perhaps never know what difference the experience might have made.  That&#8217;s really what I think about now as my son prepares to go to college, where I did not.  His Mother and I have always wanted him to go to college; his Mother did (Magna Cum Laude) and I did not.  But I held on to that regret and, making what is perhaps a well understood mistake that parents make, wanted that above many things for him.

I only have a few significant regrets.&nbsp; I hold on to those regrets as some of the most important lessons I&#8217;ve ever learned.&nbsp; So, in that way at least, they can serve some purpose.
