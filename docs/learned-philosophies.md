I&#8217;ve often said that one should become wiser as one ages; everything else is a downside.&nbsp; That may not be completely true, but it strikes me as a good philosophy to hold when growing older.&nbsp; 

I&#8217;m sure some people are born wise, but I&#8217;ve yet to meet one.&nbsp; There is a marked difference between smart people that are young and smart people that are old.&nbsp; That difference must be one of experience, and resulting wisdom.&nbsp; Wisdom is hard earned.&nbsp; The most valuable lessons are the hard ones.&nbsp; The wounds that hurt the worst are self-inflicted.&nbsp; There is a cost to learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Having reached an age of some maturity, at least according to the math, I find myself recognizing patterns, repeated questions and repeating responses to all sorts of ideas and events, both large and small.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like the opportunity to comment on some of these and to refine my thoughts in an organized(ish) way.&nbsp; Writing, which I have not done enough of, has always been away to do that.&nbsp; Keeps the rambling down a bit.
