# Learned Philosophies

### I've often said that one should become wiser as one ages; everything else is a downside.  That may not be completely true, but it strikes me as a good philosophy to hold when growing older.

### I'm sure some people are born wise, but I've yet to meet one.  There is a marked difference between smart people that are young and smart people that are old.  That difference must be one of experience, and resulting wisdom.  Wisdom is hard earned.  The most valuable lessons are the hard ones.  The wounds that hurt the worst are self-inflicted.

### There is a cost to learning.

### Having reached an age of some maturity, at least according to the math, I find myself recognizing patterns, repeated questions and repeating responses to all sorts of ideas and events, both large and small.  I'd like the opportunity to comment on some of these and to refine my thoughts in an organized(ish) way.  Writing, which I have not done enough of, has always been away to do that.

### Keeps the rambling down a bit.
