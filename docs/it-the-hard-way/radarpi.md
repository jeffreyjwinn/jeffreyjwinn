# RADAR Pi

In my neighborhood, we have a problem.  There are way to many houses, to many moving here (who wouldn't?) and exactly NO speedbumps.  Add some new drivers, late drivers, contractors (no offense, just experience) and you have speeders.

The local home owner's association (HOA) won't do anything about it because the roads are under the governance of the local county highway group.  Truth be told, the HOA doesn't do much about anything at all.

We have little, *little* kids roaming the sidewalks and streets in our neighborhood.  We have elderly folks riding their bikes and trikes.  It is not a matter of *if* someone gets hurt, but *when*.  The posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour (MPH), which is too fast in my view. 

Because we live on the "main" road, our little street has become a highway for eager new homeowners from out of state to race back to their house.  I've seen people pass others in front of my house.  Too many people, going too fast, even though this *should* be a part of the neighborhood and therefore their concern.

We've asked the HOA to do something about it.  We've asked the local authority to do something about it.  Nobody has.


Now, you know as well as I do what happens with a hacker mentality when you don't get justice from the system; you take matters into your own hands.

## The RADAR Pi Project

The original project idea came from [here](https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Radar-Speed-Sign/).  It is a bit dated (2017) and has some features I don't use, but the bones are here.

You can check out the parts list in the original guide.  I didn't want to use the large, 7-segment displays from the original article, but I may add something like that later.  To that end, I wound up placing the whole solution on a breadboard-enabled chassis.  I also probably should have used the more current version of the RADAR module ([OPS243-C](https://omnipresense.com/product/ops243-c-fmcw-and-doppler-radar-sensor-with-wifi-bluetooth-interface/) vs what I got, the [OPS241-A](https://omnipresense.com/product/ops241-a-short-range-radar-sensor/)).
