If you OS changes aren&#8217;t doing the trick for these apps, here is a found nugget.

You have to do this with the (typically) Advanced Config Editor. Search there for _layout.css.devPixelsPerPx_. When you find it:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <br /><em>change its value to 1.0 and click OK to save it. This will give you classic 96 dpi fonts. To enlarge that by 10%, double-click and use 1.1 and click OK. And so on. You may want to switch around between windows and tabs to see how it&#8217;s affecting them.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
