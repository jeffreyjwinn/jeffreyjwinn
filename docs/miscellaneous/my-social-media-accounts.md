Today I made the choice to finally remove all of my social media accounts. For me, that&#8217;s Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

While I&#8217;ve been meaning to do this for some time, what pushed me over the edge is pretty much the same thing I see every day; my fellow humans degrading and demeaning their fellow humans for whatever reason people do that. It wasn&#8217;t new, it wasn&#8217;t a surprise, but I&#8217;ve had enough.

I will be doing a piece on my view of the philosophy of Social Media, but this is just to let you know that you can no longer find me there.
