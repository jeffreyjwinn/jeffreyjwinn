# My Social Media Accounts (all of them)

Today (July 30th, 2020) I made the choice to finally remove all of my social media accounts. For me, that's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

While I've been meaning to do this for some time, what pushed me over the edge is pretty much the same thing I see every day; my fellow humans degrading and demeaning their fellow humans for whatever reason people do that. It wasn't new, it wasn't a surprise, but I've had enough.

This is just to let you know that you can no longer find me there.
