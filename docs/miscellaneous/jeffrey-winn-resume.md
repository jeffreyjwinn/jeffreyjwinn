## Summary

I believe that every role is a customer service role. Your customers may be outward or inward facing, but the goal is no different; complete customer satisfaction.

I began my career of more than  25 years in technology as an individual contributor and have enjoyed the many benefits of working with talented colleagues as well as managing a diverse group of skilled people. I am most proud of my ability to provide solutions as enabled by technology, rather than by focusing simply on the technology for its own sake.
