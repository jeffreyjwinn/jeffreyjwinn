## Summary

I believe that every role is a customer service role. Your customers may be outward or inward facing, but the goal is no different; complete customer satisfaction.

I began my career of over 20 years in technology as an individual contributor and have enjoyed the many benefits of working with talented colleagues as well as managing a diverse group of skilled people. I am most proud of my ability to provide solutions as enabled by technology, rather than by focusing simply on the technology for its own sake.

## Testimonials

> "Jeff was a bastion of calm in very turbulent waters. We were both challenged in a difficult environment where chaos was the standard operating procedure. Jeff inspired me to deliver beyond the expectations that were set upon my group, and allowed me the freedom to tackle issues creatively, without being judgmental. I learned a lot about managing from Jeff, and I would recommend him to anyone."
  
***- Eric Dencer***, *reported to Jeffrey at Vesta*

> "During my three years at nCUBE Jeff designed and managed all corporate system and network infrastructure. During this time, the corporate and engineering networks ran smoothly due to his diligence, expertise, and attention to performing the latest upgrades and configurations recommended by the vendors. In addition, Jeff went outside-the-box on many occasions to provide expert (and patient) training to those of us who needed to implement and manage complex subnets within the engineering organization. On more than one occasion Jeff volunteered his time and effort to keep the production, test, and integration train rolling smoothly down the tracks; this resulted in greater efficiency, shorter time-to-market and a much better trained workforce within the engineering IT community. I would recommend Jeff for any IT/telephony position and would absolutely work with or for him again."
